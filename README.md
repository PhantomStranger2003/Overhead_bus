- This project is build for the Project Deep Blue Season - 6 National level Hackathon with PS: Crowd Counting Challenge.
- Use case: counting the number of people in the stores/buildings/shopping malls etc., in real-time.
- Sending an alert to the staff if the people are way over the limit.
- Automating features and optimising the real-time stream for better performance (with threading).
- Acts as a measure towards footfall analysis and in a way to tackle COVID-19.
